Polinux

Polinux is a GNU/Linux distribution made by POuL, Politecnico Open unix Labs,
as a way for giving Politecnico di Milano students the possibility of trying
Linux without necessarily install it or become less productive.
This Ubuntu flavor can be used as a replacement for many Microsoft Windows
based programs used in many university courses.
The distribution also contains a script for connecting to the Politecnico
Wifi with a minimum struggle.
